## Fractals, Self-Similar and Chaotic Systems 
This repository is an experimental collection of Python scripts for simulating and visualizing chaotic attractors, bifurcations, and fractal-like dynamical systems. The goal is to explore their behavior through numerical simulation, visual pattern recognition, and basic dynamical analysis methods (e.g., Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, dimensionality metrics, Poincar√© sections, etc.).

Each script focuses on a different attractor (e.g., Lorenz, Rossler, Aizawa, Chen-Lee) with options to animate or export 2D/3D plots.

This project will also serve as a dataset generator for future symbolic regression experiments, particularly for training PySINDy models to rediscover underlying equations from the generated time series.
